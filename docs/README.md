# Solar System Visualization Project Documentation

## Overview
An interactive 3D visualization of the solar system built using Three.js and Vite. The project features a detailed representation of planets, their satellites, and interactive elements allowing users to explore celestial bodies in our solar system.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Development Server**: Node.js
- **Version Control**: Git

## Core Features

### 1. Celestial Body Rendering
- Planets and satellites rendered as 3D spheres using Three.js
- Realistic orbital paths visualized with pulsing lines
- Dynamic lighting system with ambient and directional lights
- Custom materials and shaders for celestial bodies

### 2. Interactive Features
- Click-to-focus on planets and satellites
- Smooth camera transitions
- Orbital controls for user navigation
- Information panels for celestial bodies
- Detailed view with expanded information

### 3. Data Management
- Comprehensive planet data including physical characteristics
- Satellite information for major moons
- Expanded details available through modal views

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scene Setup
```javascript
scene = new THREE.Scene();
camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
```

### Camera Controls
- OrbitControls implementation with custom damping
- Smooth transitions between views
- Configurable zoom limits and rotation speeds

### Planet System
- Dynamic planet creation with configurable parameters
- Orbital mechanics simulation
- Satellite system with relative scaling
- Hierarchical object structure

### User Interface
- Modal-based information display
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Interactive elements with hover effects

## Animation System

### Main Animation Loop
- Continuous orbital movement
- Satellite rotation around planets
- Pulsing orbit line effects
- Performance-optimized rendering

### Camera Animations
- Smooth transitions between views
- Easing functions for natural movement
- State management during transitions

## Data Structures

### Planet Configuration
```javascript
const planetData = {
    name: String,
    description: String,
    diameter: String,
    type: String,
    distanceFromSun: String,
    orbitalPeriod: String,
    surfaceTemp: String,
    color: HexColor
}
```

### Satellite Configuration
```javascript
const satelliteData = {
    name: String,
    description: String,
    diameter: String,
    type: String,
    distanceFromPlanet: String,
    orbitalPeriod: String,
    surfaceTemp: String
}
```

## Event Handling

### Mouse Interactions
- Click detection using raycasting
- Object selection and focus
- Camera position updates
- Information panel display

### Window Events
